Color is one of the most influential tools we have as designers, whether we're visual designers or not. And it has the power to do a lot of things for us. It can set a brand's tone and draw users' attention. But it can be tricky to find the right combination of colors and then applying those colors to your design

So, how can you use colors to enhance your design?

The choice of a color pallette and its application to a design are not mere happy accidents. It takes iteration and carefull application to really benefit and take full advantage of a color in a UI. Appropriate color use can enhance brand perception, draw attention and encourage interactions, impact users' emtions, and icrease usability

<h2> Choose a color harmony </h2>
You could think of color harmonies as the building blocks or the underlying template of a color pallette. Some common color harmonies are:

<b>Analogous = </b> colors that are next to each other on the color wheel (This color harmony creates low color contrast)

<b>Complementary = </b> colors that are opposite on the color wheel, which produce higj color contrast.

<b>Split-complementary = </b> a color combined with others from either side of its complementary color.

<b>Tridic = </b> three equidistant colors ( 120 degrees apart) on the color wheel.

<b>Monochromatic = </b> tones and shades of a single hue

<h2> Limit your palette to three colors</h2>

A small number of colors reinforces visual hierarcgy and contrast because there is less for users to consider and get distracted by.

For example, have you ever had a hard time finding a specific cereal in the cereal asle? That's because there are so many colors! All the colors are competing for your attention.

The same is true for your designs.
<b>Less is more.</b>

<h2> The 60 - 30 -10 rule</h2>

This rule means that color should be used in 60%, 30%, and 10%. So in other words, use 60% for the dominant color, 30% for the seconday color, and 10% for an accent color.

This is a way of thinking, because you can't count how much of a color do you use.

<h2> Apply then iterate your colors</h2>

Once you've used the 60 - 30 - 10 rule, you'll need to take a step back and see what's working and what's not, then tweak your colors. Ask yourself questions like, do your color choice help create the right visual hierarchy?

So, in other words, is your eye drawn to these elements in the design that you want to empasize? Do your color choices create balance and contrast in your design?

Look for contrast!

<h2> Use colors consistently in your interface</h2>

If you use bright pink for your calls to action one one screen, that same color should be used for calls to action everywhere, unless you have a insanely good reason for deviating from that color.
