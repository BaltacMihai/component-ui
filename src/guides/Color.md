<h2> What are colors?</h2>
<br>
Color is one of the most influential tools we have as designers, whether we're visual designers or not. And it has the power to do a lot of things for us. It can set a brand's tone and draw users' attention. But it can be tricky to find the right combination of colors and then applying those colors to your design
<br>
So, how can you use colors to enhance your design?
<br>
The choice of a color pallette and its application to a design are not mere happy accidents. It takes iteration and carefull application to really benefit and take full advantage of a color in a UI. Appropriate color use can enhance brand perception, draw attention and encourage interactions, impact users' emtions, and icrease usability

<h2> Choose a color harmony </h2>
<br>

You could think of color harmonies as the building blocks or the underlying template of a color pallette. Some common color harmonies are:
<br><br>
<b>Analogous = </b> colors that are next to each other on the color wheel (This color harmony creates low color contrast)

<b>Complementary = </b> colors that are opposite on the color wheel, which produce higj color contrast.

<b>Split-complementary = </b> a color combined with others from either side of its complementary color.

<b>Tridic = </b> three equidistant colors ( 120 degrees apart) on the color wheel.

<b>Monochromatic = </b> tones and shades of a single hue

<h2> Limit your palette to three colors</h2>
<br>
A small number of colors reinforces visual hierarcgy and contrast because there is less for users to consider and get distracted by.
<br>
For example, have you ever had a hard time finding a specific cereal in the cereal asle? That's because there are so many colors! All the colors are competing for your attention.
<br>
The same is true for your designs.<br>
<b>Less is more.</b>

<h2> The 60 - 30 -10 rule</h2>
<br>
This rule means that color should be used in 60%, 30%, and 10%. So in other words, use 60% for the dominant color, 30% for the seconday color, and 10% for an accent color.
<br>
This is a way of thinking, because you can't count how much of a color do you use.

<h2> Apply then iterate your colors</h2>
<br>
Once you've used the 60 - 30 - 10 rule, you'll need to take a step back and see what's working and what's not, then tweak your colors. Ask yourself questions like, do your color choice help create the right visual hierarchy?
<br>
So, in other words, is your eye drawn to these elements in the design that you want to empasize? Do your color choices create balance and contrast in your design?
<br>
Look for contrast!

<h2> Use colors consistently in your interface</h2>
<br>
If you use bright pink for your calls to action one one screen, that same color should be used for calls to action everywhere, unless you have a insanely good reason for deviating from that color.
