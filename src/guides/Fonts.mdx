    Typography is more than just selecting attractive fonts: it is an essential
    component of user interface design.
  </p>
  <p>
    Good typography will create a strong visual hierarchy, bring aesthetic
    balance to the website, and define the overall tone for the product.
    Typography should guide and enlighten your users, improve readability and
    accessibility, and provide a positive user experience.
  </p>
  <p>Let's take a closer look at why typography is so crucial.</p>
</section>

<section id={internalLinks[1].link}>
  <h2>{internalLinks[1].name}</h2>
  <p>Let's start with the basics: what exactly is typography?</p>
  <p>
    The skill of arranging letters and text in such a way that the content is
    legible, clear, and visually appealing to the reader is known as typography.
  </p>
  <p>
    But what exactly is typography? Simply stated, typography is the look or
    style of text. It may also apply to the art of working with words, which you
    very certainly do on a regular basis whether you write documents or other
    projects for work, school, or yourself.
  </p>
  <h3> Ok... But why? </h3>
</section>

<section id={internalLinks[2].link}>
  <h2>{internalLinks[2].name}</h2>
  <p>
    Good typography may mean the difference between someone spending one minute
    or half an hour on your website.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's critical that your website be aesthetically appealing and memorable,
    and typography plays a big part in that.

<section id={internalLinks[3].link}>
  <h2>{internalLinks[3].name}</h2>
  <p>
    The way that consumers understand and interpret the information contained in
    the text is significantly influenced by the typography.
  </p>
  <p>
    Strong fonts that support the text's theme are far more persuasive than
    weaker type.
