    The user will quit your site instantly if it has a terrible color palette
    but good content. However, if the color palette is nicely picked, the user
    may give the site a chance.
  </p>
  <p>
    Before we go into whether color palettes are excellent or bad, let's define
    color.

    Color is one of the most powerful tools we have as designers, whether we are
    UI desingers or not. And it has the ability to perform a variety of things
    for us. It may establish the tone for a brand and attract people' attention.
    However, finding the appropriate color combination and then applying those
    colors to your design might be difficult.
  </p>
  <p>So, how can you include color into your design?</p>
  <p>
    The selection of a color palette and its application to a design are not
    coincidental. Iteration and careful application are required to fully
    benefit from and take use of a color in a UI. Color may improve brand
    impression, capture attention and stimulate interactions, influence user
    emotions, and increase usability.

  <h3> How? </h3>

<section id={internalLinks[2].link}>
  <h2>{internalLinks[2].name}</h2>
  <p>
    Because there are fewer colors to ponder and be distracted by, fewer colors
    enhance visual hierarchy and contrast.
  </p>
  <p>
    Have you ever struggled to locate a particular cereal in the cereal aisle,
    for instance? That is as a result of the abundance of colors! Every color is
    fighting for your attention.
  </p>
  <img src="/componentui/color/market.jpg" style="width: 500px;" />
  <p>The same is true for your designs.</p>
  <p>
    <b>Less is more.</b>
  </p>
  <h3> But how? </h3>
</section>

<section id={internalLinks[3].link}>
  <h2>{internalLinks[3].name}</h2>
  <p>
    The 60/30/10 guideline, often known as <b>The Golden Rule</b>, states that
    color should be utilised 60%, 30%, and 10% of the time. In other words, use
    60% for the dominant color, 30% for the secondary color, and 10% for the
    accent color.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is more like a style of thinking because it's impossible to quantify
    the amount of color you utilize.
  </p>
  <img src="/componentui/color/img-60-30-10.svg" style="width: 750px;" />
  <p>
    The <b>60%</b> is usually the netral or primary color. This portion will be
    used as the base color of the design;
  </p>
  <p>
    The <b>30%</b> is the secondary color. It is still visible and will be used
    for some medium components such as card, carousel, etc.;
  </p>
  <p>
    The <b>10%</b> is the accent color. This portion will be used for highlight
    of the design. For example, CTA buton, pop up, and some important points of
    your interface.;
  </p>
  <h3> Now that we have the colors, how do we use them? </h3>

<section id={internalLinks[4].link}>
  <h2>{internalLinks[4].name}</h2>
  <p>
    After applying the 60-30-10 guideline, you'll need to step back and assess
    what's working and what isn't before making adjustments to your color
    scheme. Do your color choices help establish the proper visual hierarchy,
    for example?
  </p>
  <p>
    In other words, is your attention pulled to the design components you wish
    to emphasize? Do the colors you've chosen help your design have harmony and
    contrast?
  </p>
  <img src="/componentui/color/iterateColors.svg" style="width: 1000px;" />
  <p>
    Look for <b>contrast</b>!
  </p>
</section>

<section id={internalLinks[5].link}>
  <h2>{internalLinks[5].name}</h2>
  <p>
    Contrast aids in the organization of your design and the establishment of a
    hierarchy, which simply displays which components of your design are more
    significant (and signals viewers to focus on those). However, excellent
    contrast provides visual appeal to your design in addition to underlining
    the focus point.
  </p>
  <p>A poor contrast might make it difficult to interpret the design.</p>

    If your calls to action on one screen are purple, you should use the same
    color for calls to action everywhere, unless you have an absurdly excellent
    reason to stray from it.
