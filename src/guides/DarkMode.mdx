    The light-on-dark color scheme is a color scheme that employs light-colored
    text, icons, and graphical user interface components on a dark background.
    It is also known as dark mode, dark theme, or night mode.
  </p>
  <p>
    Light mode (also known as day mode) is a color scheme that employs dark
    text, icons, and graphical user interface components on a light backdrop.

    There are several disagreements over people's tastes; some like light mode,
    while others prefer dark mode. There are strong supporters on both sides,
    and every position is supported by facts and research. Let's look at some of
    the most often debated subjects.
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>
      I'm not going to start an argument here, but I will provide an example
    </i>
  </p>
  <h3>What are the characteristics of regular people?</h3>
  <p>
    Because we are interested in how people were taught, we want to find out how
    they were used to see the content.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have been surrounded by black writing on light backgrounds for many
    years, even before computers, in the form of newspapers and books. Instead,
    computers used to have a default dark mode, which had white text on a black
    background, to make the energy consumed by the PC more efficient. This
    became less of an issue with time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because the amount of hours spent in front of a screen has risen in recent
    years, several studies have been conducted to identify their impacts.
    According to the American Optometric Association's (AOA) American Eye-QÂ®
    study, 58 percent of individuals have suffered from digital eye strain or
    vision issues as a direct result. This is provided by "blue" light, which is
    not present in nature. Another research found that using darkmode helps to
    reduce the intensity of this artificial light.
  </p>
  <b> How can we reduce these problems? </b>
  <p>
    We provide the user the freedom to make his own decisions. Therefore, if it
    is possible, we must build for both dark and light modes.
  </p>
  <b>However, there's a catch...</b>

  <p>
    A pure color is one that has the highest saturation in each hue. Colors are
    classified into two types: achromatic colors like white, grey, and black,
    and chromatic colors like red, green, and blue.
  </p>
  <p>Try to image the RGB ( Red Green Blue ) </p>
  <Table
    header={["Color Name", "RGB", "Red", "Green", "Blue"]}
    data={[
      ["White", " RGB( 255 255 255 )", "255", "255", "255"],
      ["Black", " RGB( 0 0 0 )", "0", "0", "0"],
      ["Red", " RGB( 255 0 0 )", "255", "0", "0"],
      ["Green", " RGB( 0 255 0 )", "0", "255", "0"],
      ["Blue", " RGB( 0 0 255 )", "0", "0", "255"],
    ]}
  />
  <p>For reading, a high color contrast is beneficial.</p>
  <p>
    However, reading pure color text against a pure color background can be
    eye-straining when done for long periods of time.
  </p> <img
    src="/componentui/darkVsLightMode/pureColors.svg"
    width="500"
    style="border: 1px solid #c9caef; padding: 1rem;"
  />
  <p>
    Black has 0% color brightness compared to 100% for white, which results in
    high light levels that overstimulate the eyes.
  </p>
  <img
    src="/componentui/darkVsLightMode/blackWhiteColors.svg"
    width="500"
    style="border: 1px solid #c9caef; padding: 1rem; background: #ccc"
  />
  <b>So, what can we do?</b>
  <p>
    Just avoid using pure colors is everything you need to do. Instead of using
    pure colors, try to employ shades of white or black.
  </p>
  <img
    src="/componentui/darkVsLightMode/blackWhiteTransform.svg"
    width="500"
    style="border: 1px solid #c9caef; padding: 1rem; background: #ccc"
  />
  <p>
    The colors appear extremely similar, if not identical, at first glance, but
    over time as our user browses the website, his eyes will grow tired more
    slowly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Okay, but our design also includes colors in addition to different tones of
    black and white. We don't have to utilize pure colors, as we saw above. What
    should we do with the remaining hues in the color scheme?
  </p>

<section id={internalLinks[3].link}>

  <p>
    At first look, we might assume that we can leave our colors in their current
    state if they aren't pure hues.
  </p>
  <img
    src="/componentui/darkVsLightMode/neonColors.svg"
    width="500"
    style="border: 1px solid #c9caef; padding: 1rem; background: #ccc"
  />
  <p>
    Consider making the color in the circle above the dominant color, as it will
    be seen frequently. Even though this works perfectly in white mode, it does
    not address the issue of tired eyes in dark mode.
  </p>
  <p class="bold block">So, what we do?</p>
  <p>We will convert our colors to dark mode, it's that easy.</p>
  <p class="bold block">...</p>
  <p class="bold block">Ok, now how do we do that?</p>
  <p>
    There are many ways to do this on the Internet. In principle, you take your
    color and give it opacity . 55 or .6, but many problems can appear, because
    if that color is on a different shade than the background (dark mode), it
    will change, giving a different color.
  </p>
  <p>
    For this problem, there is a solution,

      the color calculator.

    This is an application that the community asked us for and we offer it. More
    details about how it works can be found on its page.

    width="500"
    style="border: 1px solid #c9caef; padding: 1rem; background: #ccc"
  />
  <p>
    The concept is the same as with the black and white tone; it might not even
    be noticeable, but these values tire on the eye more slowly.
