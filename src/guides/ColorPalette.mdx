<div class="disclaimer">
  <p> I recommend studying this guide after going through the </p>

    A color palette is the combination of colors used in many creative and
    design situations.
  </p>
  <p>
    This offers guidance on how to use a brand's particular colors when it comes
    to graphic design.
  </p>
  <p class="bold block"> Why?</p>
  <p>
    Because consistent color use throughout all graphic assets, including
    posters and websites, makes a brand easier to recognize.
  </p>
  <p>
    We discovered from the "color" guide that we must restrict our use of color,
    leading to the creation of the{" "}
    <a
      href="https://baltacmihai.github.io/componentui/color/#The_60_30_10_rule"
      class="link"
    >
      60/30/10 guideline
    </a>
    . A color palette is created by these values.
  </p>
  <h3> How do we create a good color palette? </h3>
  <p>
    We may construct a solid palette in a variety of ways, therefore I'll break
    it down into three categories:
  </p>

<section id={internalLinks[1].link}>

  <p>
    Making fresh connections between previously established ideas or concepts is
    one definition of creativity. Therefore, we can "copy" components from
    various parts to create our final product. This approach is recommended in
    terms of user experience. Because the user will mentally associate our color
    scheme with familiarity if they have previously used an application with a
    similar color scheme.
  </p>
  <p>Social media platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn are an example.</p>
  <img

    width="500"
    style="border: 1px solid #c9caef; padding: 1rem"
  />
  <p>or Pinterest and YouTube</p>
  <img
    src="/componentui/colorPallete/YoutubeVsPinterest.svg"
    width="500"
    style="border: 1px solid #c9caef; padding: 1rem"
  />
  <p>
    It is clear that they don't exactly have the same color scheme, yet they are
    pretty close nonetheless.

    . We selected to present four colors each, the first for "white space" and the
    final for text color.

  <p>
    This approach to developing effective color palettes is by far the most
    challenging and exciting. I do not advise beginners to use this technique.
  </p>

  <p>An image can be used to create an infinite number of palettes.</p>

    Color harmonies can be viewed as the foundational elements or basic design
    of a color palette. Typical color harmonies include:
  </p> <img src="/componentui/colorPallete/analogous.svg" /> <p>
    <b>Analogous = </b> colors that are next to each other on the color wheel
    (This color harmony creates low color contrast)
  </p>
  <img src="/componentui/colorPallete/complementary.svg" />
  <p>
    <b>Complementary = </b> colors that are opposite on the color wheel, which
    produce high color contrast.
  </p> <img src="/componentui/colorPallete/Split-complementary.svg" />
  <p>
    <b> Split-complementary = </b> a color combined with others from either side
    of its complementary color.
  </p>
  <img src="/componentui/colorPallete/Tridic.svg" />
  <p>
    <b>Tridic = </b> three equidistant colors ( 120 degrees apart) on the color
    wheel.
  </p>
  <img src="/componentui/colorPallete/Monochromatic.svg" />
  <p>
    <b>Monochromatic = </b> tones and shades of a single hue
